Your task is to develop a Python script that finds pure Nash equilibria in 2x2 games using the best response approach. The program should have a text-based interface and include the following features:\n",
        "\n",
        "    1. A function to represent a 2x2 game using nested lists.\n",
        "    2. A function to calculate best responses for each player.\n",
        "    3. A function to find pure Nash equilibria based on best responses.\n",
        "    4. A text-based interface for users to input game payoffs and view results.\n",
        "    5. Clear display of the game, best responses, and Nash equilibria.\n",
        "    6. Proper error handling and input validation.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Important Notes:\n",
        "    - Use nested lists to represent the game: [[[a,b],[c,d]], [[e,f],[g,h]]] where the first sublist is Player 1's payoffs and the second is Player 2's.\n",
        "    - Implement the best response calculation for each player's strategies, considering cases where strategies might be equally good.\n",
        "    - Add detailed comments to explain key steps, especially the best response and Nash equilibrium logic.\n",
        "    - Ensure the text interface is user-friendly and provides clear instructions.\n",
        "    - Include an option for users to analyze multiple games without restarting the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Best Response Calculation:\n",
        "    - For each player and each strategy of the other player, determine which strategy yields the highest payoff.\n",
        "    - If both strategies yield equal payoffs, both should be considered as best responses.\n",
        "    - Return best responses as a list of lists: [[p1_br1, p1_br2], [p2_br1, p2_br2]], where each br can be 1, 2, or 'Both'.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Nash Equilibrium Finding Algorithm:\n",
        "    - A strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium if no player can unilaterally deviate and improve their payoff.\n",
        "    - Implement the following steps:\n",
        "      1. Iterate through all four possible strategy combinations: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2).\n",
        "      2. For each combination (i,j):\n",
        "         - Check if strategy i is a best response for Player 1 to Player 2's strategy j\n",
        "         - AND if strategy j is a best response for Player 2 to Player 1's strategy i\n",
        "      3. If both conditions are true, add (i,j) to the nash_equilibria list.\n",
        "    - Handle cases where multiple strategies might be equally good (i.e., when best_responses contains 'Both').\n",
        "    - Ensure the function works correctly for games with 0, 1, or 2 Nash equilibria.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Text Interface:\n",
        "    - Prompt the user to enter payoffs for both players.\n",
